  - I work as a Laravel Developer at V-Empower Inc., focusing on developing cutting-edge web applications. One of my main projects is MyCaly, an appointment and events booking app that serves as a sub-product of our primary video conferencing app, MeetHour.
  - MyCaly streamlines the process of booking events and joining meetings via the MeetHour platform, all within our app itself. Users simply need to connect their MeetHour account and their Google Calendar to MyCaly, and they can enjoy a seamless experience without leaving the app.
  - My role involves leveraging Laravel, Livewire, MySQL, and the MeetHour SDK to build efficient and reliable solutions.
  - I started working in V-Empower from August as as intern, built couple of projects using React.js, Node.js and SQLite and integrated SDK of our Meet Hour App.
  - Then transitioned to Laravel from November and started working on Live-Class Management project. This project included integrating MeetHour, enabling tutors to book and manage classes for their students.
  - Since December, I've been dedicated to the MyCaly project, collaborating with other developers to ensure its success. We've created a seamless experience connecting appointment booking with video conferencing, enhancing user productivity and convenience.
